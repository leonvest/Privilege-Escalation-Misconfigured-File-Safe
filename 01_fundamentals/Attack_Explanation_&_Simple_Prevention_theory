/etc/passwd World-Writable Privilege Escalation Attack
Attack Explanation

What Happened?
This attack exploits a critical misconfiguration where the /etc/passwd file has world-writable permissions (all users can write to it). By adding a new user with 
UID 0 (root) and no password, an attacker can gain root privileges without authentication.

Vulnerable Configuration:

-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root /etc/passwd    # VULNERABLE
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow /etc/shadow  # Secure

Why It Works:

* Historically, /etc/passwd stored password hashes

* Modern systems use /etc/shadow for passwords

* However, if a user has write access to /etc/passwd, they can create accounts

* UID 0 always equals root, regardless of username





Prevention Guide - Immediate Actions

1. Check current permissions:

ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow


2. Fix permissions:

sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd
sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow
sudo chown root:root /etc/passwd
sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow


3. Check for malicious entries:

grep ":0:" /etc/passwd
